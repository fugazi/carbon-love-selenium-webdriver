# Carbon Love - Selenium Webdriver Project

This is an Automation project using Java with Selenium Webdriver, developed by Douglas Urrea Ocampo to improve learning on advanced Automation testing.

The main features of this project has the following:

* Page Object Model (POM) as a design pattern for creating an Object directory for web UI elements.
* Encapsulation and Data Abstraction to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
* The re-usability of code to avoid unnecessary data exposure to the user by using the abstraction.

### ‚ö° Automation Test Strategy
This is an end-to-end UI tests using Selenium Webdriver.
The website under test was developed by SauceLabs [here](https://www.saucedemo.com) with a login frontpage in order to test different login access and difficult to work with locators on the UI. I must say it was fun learning and automating this website.

1. Browser is Microsoft Edge in order to have a different approach to login
2. User will navigate to the website and login with different access:
* Test login with valid credentials: STANDARD_USER
* Test login with error message: LOCKED_OUT_USER
* Test login with invalid credentials: INVALID_USER
3. Once the Login step is successful, registered user will log in the website.
4. After the login, assertions will be validated to each test, user will check for the logo and the items displayed on top of the banner menu.
5. Each tests will finish automatically and the browser will be closed.
